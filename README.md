# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
Titanic Survival Prediction (Kaggle Dataset)

This project builds a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the popular Kaggle dataset. The goal is to explore key factors that influenced survival and compare the performance of different classification models.

📌 Project Objectives
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Handle missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked, etc.)

Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand survival factors

Engineer meaningful features (Title extraction, Family size, etc.)

Train and evaluate ML models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

Compare model accuracy and select the best performer
